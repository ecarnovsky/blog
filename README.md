# My Blog
This is going to be my future blog. I just started working on it on 2/13/24 so please check back at a later date to see it finished!

Front End: HTML, CSS/SASS, and JS.

Back End: Spring Boot, Maven, and Thymeleaf.

You can also see it in its current state [here](https://blog-4rqo.onrender.com) (Will take a few minutes to load).
